Hi, I’m Wenqi! 👋

I’m a PhD student at Zhejiang University, working on 3D and video generative models. During my PhD, I was fortunate to intern at ByteDance.

**I am actively seeking research internships and collaborations in 3D AIGC and multimodal generative foundation models. If you share similar interests, feel free to <a href="mailto:wqdong98@gmail.com?subject=Internship Opportunity – [Name], [Institute]">contact me</a>.**
