Hi, I’m Wenqi! 👋

I’m a PhD student at Zhejiang University, working on 3D and video generative models. During my PhD, I was fortunate to intern at ByteDance.

**I am seeking collaborations in the area of foundation models, with a focus on multimodal generation and alignment.** If you share similar interests, feel free to <a href="mailto:wqdong98@gmail.com?subject=Internship Opportunity – [Name], [Institute]">contact me</a>.
